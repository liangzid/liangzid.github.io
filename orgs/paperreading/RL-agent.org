Paper: [[https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13194][Proposer-Agent-Evaluator(PAE): Autonomous Skill Discovery For Foundation Model Internet Agents]]

** Observations (what a VLM can see)

Domain-specific Observations and Actions

Number Marks:

 "To provide better
 action grounding, we follow the practice from prior works (Zheng et al., 2024; He et al., 2024) to
 augment the observation space with number marks on top of each interactive element such as web
 links and text boxes."
 
 
** Task Proposer (how to generate corpus)

1. Prompt, and only use the =website name=
 as the information
2. Provide the context information of a website
3. Provide some screenshots and user demos (usage cases)

** Evaluator (How to provide the reward & How to evaluate)

The reward is 0/1, purely result-oriented.

1. the success of the final outcome
2. Using VLMs as the annotator to provide the feedback


** CoT Training (How to train with reasoning)

+ Using the Filtered Behavior Cloning (Filtered BC) as the RL algorithm.


** Experiments

*** Datasets or Environments

+ WebVoyager
  + Desc: 15 websites, 643 tasks (Now 13 websites with 557 tasks are available)
  + https://github.com/MinorJerry/WebVoyager
  + https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13919
+ WebArena
  + Desc: 812 hand-crafted tasks on 5 websites
  + https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13854

*** Performances

** TODO Source code Analysis

TODO.


* WebArena: A Realistic Web Environment for Building Autonomous Agents

** Website Selection

analyze 200 user's browser histories, and select 4 representative categories:
+ E-commerce (Amazon, eBay)
+ Social forum platforms (Reddit, StackExchange)
+ Collaborative development platforms (GitLab)
+ Content Management Systems (CMS)

  And then they build a simulation version of these websites.


** Observations

A browser view, with tabs and web pages.

+ HTML file of the webpage & a DOM tree
+ screenshot of the current web page
+ accessibility tree of the web page. see: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Accessibility_tree


** Actions

"emulates the keyboard and mouse operations"

** Intents

Some universal templates while difficult and unique for each task.
